# Cloud CMS Application Server

The Cloud CMS Application Server is an open-source, Node.js powered server that provides facilities for building
web applications and API tiers that connect to Cloud CMS.

Applications built using the application server can be run standalone to serve content from Cloud CMS.
The application server provides for fast content retrieval, CDN-friendly caching and other performance optimizations 
that you would want from an application server tier.  It also supports templates, layouts and tags for rendering 
content-driven pages on the fly.

This repository provides two examples that serve as starting points for your own apps:

- /standalone - a standalone Node.js application
- /docker - a sample Dockerfile for building your own Docker images to host your application
